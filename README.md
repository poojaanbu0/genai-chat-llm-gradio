## Development and Deployment of a 'Chat with LLM' Application Using the Gradio Blocks Framework

### AIM:
To design and deploy a "Chat with LLM" application by leveraging the Gradio Blocks UI framework to create an interactive interface for seamless user interaction with a large language model.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Building a user-friendly application that allows seamless interaction with a large language model (LLM) is challenging without requiring specialized API keys or external resources. This project addresses the need for an accessible, open-source solution to implement such applications using pre-trained models and the Gradio Blocks framework.

### DESIGN STEPS:

### **STEP 1: Import Required Libraries**
- Install and import the necessary libraries:
  - **Gradio** for the UI.
  - **Transformers** for using pre-trained models.

### **STEP 2: Load a Pre-Trained Model**
- Use a pre-trained model like **GPT-2** or **DialoGPT** from Hugging Face.
- Initialize the model using the `pipeline` API for straightforward interaction.

### **STEP 3: Define Application Workflow**
- Create a function to:
  1. Process user input.
  2. Pass it to the language model.
  3. Return the generated response.
  
- Design the user interface using Gradio Blocks, adding components for input, output, and interactivity.

### **STEP 4: Deploy the Application**
- Run the application locally with `demo.launch()`.
- Optionally deploy it to the cloud for broader accessibility.
